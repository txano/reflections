What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A new .git file gets created. This file is where git stores all its data.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a space where changes are going to happen. You can choose whether or not to save the changes you made.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By running the git diff --staged.
