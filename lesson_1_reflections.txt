How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It removed the excess code in order to see it faster

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Being able to troubleshoot bugs and working faster in correcting them

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Because not everytime you change something you want it to be saved as it may be experimenting, and having a lot of files clutters everything

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    So that it is easier to revert to a previous version and fix problems if all the files are saved at the same point of time

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    you can use git log to see all the commits made and git diff to evaluate the differences between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Since you can revert to a previous working state there is no problem in introducing bugs
    
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Just for version control because line command is a bit boring :(
